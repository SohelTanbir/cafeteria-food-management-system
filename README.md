## Individual Tasks:
First of all, we work as a team. Every team member takes his/her responsibility
and completes it within the budget time. The team lead will oversee project
coordination, conduct timely milestone reviews, and ensure the project
progresses according to the established timeline. All team members will actively
participate in iterative development, user feedback sessions, and documentation
throughout the project.

## Tools and Technologies:
### Programming Language
The CUB Food System has been developed using the C++ programming language,
known for its efficiency and simplicity in system-level programming.
## development environment
We CodeBlock integrated development environment (IDE) for C++ programming,
ensuring a smooth and efficient coding process.
## Database Management System:
We used a text file (.txt) as our Application database. We store the food menu in a text
file and read, write, and finally show the result.
Version Control System:
We use Git and GitHub to control our software version and collaborate with
our team.
